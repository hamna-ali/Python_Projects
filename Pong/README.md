# 🕹️ PONG GAME (Python Turtle)

A classic two-player Pong game recreated using Python's `turtle` module. This simple arcade game features paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoring system — all built from scratch using object-oriented programming.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Player 1 controls the **left paddle** using `W` (up) and `S` (down)
- Player 2 controls the **right paddle** using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys
- The ball bounces off paddles and walls
- If a player misses the ball, the opponent gains a point

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- No external libraries needed  
  (Uses built-in `turtle` and `time` modules)
