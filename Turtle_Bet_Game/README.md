# üê¢ TURTLE RACE GAME

This is a fun, console-interactive Python game built using the `turtle` module, where six colorful turtles race across the screen. The player places a bet by entering a turtle color, and then watches the race unfold in real time. The turtles move forward by random distances until one crosses the finish line, and the game announces whether the player's chosen turtle won or lost.
