- ✅ Build interactive **GUI applications with `tkinter`**, including buttons, labels, canvas, and event handling
- ✅ Use **`pandas`** for reading and manipulating structured data from CSV files
- ✅ Handle **file operations** for saving and retrieving data in `.txt` and `.json` formats
- ✅ Work with **external modules** like `pyperclip` for clipboard integration
- ✅ Use **randomization and timing** (`random`, `time`, `after()`) to create dynamic and interactive behaviors
- ✅ Understand how **math operations** and logic drive real-time applications like timers and converters
