# ðŸ§  FLASHCARD LANGUAGE LEARNING APP (French-English)

A GUI-based flashcard app built with Python's `tkinter`, `random`, and `pandas` libraries to help users learn French vocabulary. The app displays a French word, waits a few seconds, then flips the card to show the English translation. Users can mark known words, and the app keeps score accordingly.

## ðŸ§¾ How It Works

- Loads French-English word pairs from a CSV file
- Displays one French word at a time
- Automatically flips to show the English translation after 3 seconds
- Users mark whether they know the word or not using buttons
- Known words are removed from the list, and the score increases
- Game ends when all words are mastered
